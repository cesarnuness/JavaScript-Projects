# Javascript-Projects
Learning and creating my own apps!

I will log my jorney in this repository while learning JavaScript; I already learnt the basics and did several exercises using functions, loops, arrays, objects and such... From now on, I will try to save little games and small projects here.

Rock, Paper and Scissors (Using algorithms to play with the console)
Guess my Number (How to handle different classes while inputing some logics)
Modal (Manipulating Classes, Keyboard and click events)
