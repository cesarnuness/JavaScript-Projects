# Javascript-Projects
Learning and creating my own apps!

I will log my jorney in this repository while learning JavaScript; I already learnt the basics and did several exercises using functions, loops, arrays, objects and such... From now on, I will try to save little games and small projects here.

1-Rock, Paper and Scissors (Using algorithms to play with the console)

2-Guess my Number (How to handle different classes while inputing some logics)

3-Modal (Manipulating Classes, Keyboard and click events)

4-Pig Game
